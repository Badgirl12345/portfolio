      <h3>I'm a <span>Future Web Designer</span></h3>
      <p>I am Aditi Singh, a passionate and determined 2nd-year Computer Science diploma student at Government Polytechnic College Sidhi.
         With a natural curiosity for how technology shapes our world, I began my journey into web development with HTML and CSS. As I explored more, 
         I discovered a deep interest in designing creative and user-friendly websites. My goal is to become a skilled full-stack web developer who can build meaningful digital experiences that solve real-world problems.
          I am constantly learning, experimenting with new technologies, and working on small projects to sharpen my skills. Alongside my technical growth, I also value teamwork, communication, and a never-give-up attitude. 
          I believe that dedication and consistent effort are the keys to success, and I am excited to continue learning and evolving in the world of web development.
